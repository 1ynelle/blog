            <h2>Post 5 - Web Design Research 1</h2>

            <p>Edoardo Cavazza's article on "Modern CSS Techniques To Improve Legibility" offers some useful tips to make text on the web more accessible. I read this article to learn ways I can improve my blog design which is quite text-heavy. Below are a few of the tips I found interesting.</p>

            <h2>Post 4 - Portfolio Research</h2>

            <p>I think a good design portfolio site is one that shows the designer's personality and a few of their best projects. Sites I've visited have a simple navigation - home, about, contact, work -</p>

            <h2>Post 3 - MDN HTML Research</h2>

            <p>Today I'd like to share a few interesting HTML tidbits I've learned from the MDN website. When it comes to responsive images, adding the srcset and sizes attribute to the image element is useful for smaller screens when large files are not needed.</p>

            <h2>Post 2 - Article Process</h2>

            <p>Since there weren't many elements to style in my article, I tried to keep the layout simple, separating the header from the main content. After the header title and image, I used sections to divide Harjo's questions from MLK's.</p>

            <h2>Post 1 - History of the Internet</h2>
            
            <p>After watching the video, I became interested in the internet of the early 2000s and what turned it into such a major part of our lives. I found that prior to the 2000s, the internet was largely made up of static webpages, used for blogging, and emails rather than providing the interactivity of websites today.</p>
